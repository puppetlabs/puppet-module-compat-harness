# AGENTS Guide

This file is for coding agents working in this repository.

## Scope

- Use this guide for automated edits related to module intake, CI behavior, and compatibility test execution.
- Keep user-facing documentation in `README.md` and contributor process in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Primary Files

- `config/modules.json`: module definitions used by local runs and CI matrix generation.
- `config/modules.schema.json`: schema for module config validation.
- `config/beaker/setfiles/`: Beaker host definition files (one per acceptance target, e.g. `el9.yml`).
- `scripts/validate_modules_config.py`: local schema validation helper.
- `.github/workflows/compatibility-runner.yml`: CI pipeline and matrix execution.
- `profiles/puppet_profiles.json`: profile constraints used by the runner.
- `docs/architecture-flow.md`: end-to-end architecture diagram and stage reference. Must be kept in sync with runner logic, classification rules, and CI workflow changes.

## Module Addition Workflow (Agent)

1. Inspect the target module repository first (do not skip this step).
2. Add a module object under `modules` in `config/modules.json`.
3. **Insert the new module in alphabetical position** by repo name (the segment after the final `/`, lowercase, case-insensitive). The `modules` array must remain sorted alphabetically at all times because GitHub Actions renders matrix jobs in the order they appear in `modules.json`; alphabetical order makes individual jobs easy to locate in the CI panel.
4. Set `repo` (required), optionally `ref`, `id`, `os`, and `prereqs`.
5. Default behavior when omitted:
   - `ref`: treated as `main` by runner logic.
   - `os`: defaults to `ubuntu-latest` in workflow behavior.
   - `id`: derived from repo name.
6. Validate against schema before proposing completion.
7. Update [Available Acceptance Tests](./docs/available-acceptance-tests.md) documentation with information about the module being added. Make sure to update the 'last updated' date as well.

### Alphabetical Ordering Rule

- Sort key: the last path segment of `repo` (e.g. `puppet-archive` from `https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-archive`), compared case-insensitively.
- This applies to every entry — new additions, reorderings, and any cleanup edits.
- If you discover existing entries out of order during an edit, fix the order in the same change.
- Quick re-sort one-liner (run from repo root):

  ```bash
  python -c "import json; p='config/modules.json'; d=json.load(open(p)); d['modules'].sort(key=lambda m: m['repo'].rsplit('/',1)[-1].lower()); json.dump(d, open(p,'w',newline='\n'), indent=2); open(p,'a').write('\n')"
  ```

## Decision Rules

- Set `os` only when a module truly requires a specific runner image.
- Use `windows-latest` for Windows-only modules/providers.
- Use `macos-latest` only when explicitly required.
- Omit `os` for general modules to keep Ubuntu as default.
- Do not guess system package prerequisites.
- Determine `prereqs` from repository evidence before finalizing a module addition.
- Add explicit `id` only when stable custom naming is needed in artifacts/reporting.
- Set `docker_mode` to `systemd` on acceptance targets only when the module's acceptance tests assert service running/enabled state via systemd (e.g. `is_expected.to be_running`, `is_expected.to be_enabled`). Evidence: check `spec/acceptance/` for `be_running` or `be_enabled` matchers on Service resources.
- Default `docker_mode` is `sshd` — faster, more portable, and avoids privileged containers. Only escalate to `systemd` when tests require it.

## Mandatory Prereq Discovery

Before proposing a new module entry, agents must fetch and analyze the target repository at the selected `ref` (or default branch if `ref` is omitted).

Minimum files/signals to inspect:

- `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`
- `Rakefile` and custom rake tasks used by validate/spec/test
- `metadata.json`
- `.fixtures.yml` or `.sync.yml` (if present)
- `spec/spec_helper.rb`, `spec/spec_helper_local.rb`, and unit/integration specs under `spec/`
- acceptance helpers/assets under `spec/acceptance/` or `acceptance/`
- Any scripts invoked by tests (for example in `script/`, `tasks/`, or CI config)

What to extract:

- Native/system tools and libraries required by tests or providers.
- OS-specific requirements (Linux/macOS/Windows) that imply package-manager entries.
- Commands in specs/rake tasks that call external binaries.

How to write `prereqs`:

- Add only package-manager keys supported by schema (`apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `apk`, `brew`, `choco`, `pacman`).
- Include only non-empty unique package names.
- If repo evidence shows no system prereqs, `prereqs` may be omitted.
- If evidence is inconclusive, run a scoped CI attempt and derive prereqs from failure logs before finalizing.

Evidence requirement in agent response:

- Summarize which repository files were inspected.
- State why `prereqs` were added or omitted.
- Call out any assumptions and required follow-up if evidence was partial.

## Validation Checklist

Run:

```bash
python -m pip install jsonschema
python scripts/validate_modules_config.py --config config/modules.json --schema config/modules.schema.json
```

Expected result:

```text
OK: config/modules.json is valid against config/modules.schema.json
```

Also confirm:

- No duplicate `id` values.
- No unexpected module keys outside schema.
- Package lists in `prereqs` are non-empty strings without duplicates.

## Quick CI Scope Test

When you need a narrow CI run, use workflow input `modules_json` with only new or changed entries, for example:

```json
[{"repo":"https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windowsfeature","ref":"master","os":"windows-latest"}]
```

## CI Behavior Notes

- Workflow validates `config/modules.json` before matrix fan-out.
- Matrix `runs-on` follows per-module `os` when set; otherwise Ubuntu default applies.
- Cross-platform prereqs are installed by package-manager keys in `prereqs` (such as `apt`, `choco`, `brew`).
- Acceptance jobs always run on `ubuntu-latest`; the SUT is a Docker container controlled by `BEAKER_SETFILE`.
- When `PUPPET_CORE_API_KEY` is set, the runner uses a **two-stage isolation model**:
  1. **Build stage** (`build_sut_image`): runs `docker build` with the API key passed as a build arg. Puppet Core agent is installed and credentials are scrubbed from repo config files in the same Dockerfile layer so they never persist in the image.
  2. **Test stage** (`acceptance`): runs untrusted module test code (Beaker/rspec) with **no secrets in the environment**. The runner strips `PUPPET_CORE_API_KEY`, `PASSWORD`, `USERNAME`, and `BUNDLE_RUBYGEMS___PUPPETCORE__PUPPET__COM` from the env before invoking tests. The setfile references the pre-built local image tag — no credentials are embedded in the setfile.
- This design ensures third-party module test code cannot exfiltrate the API key.
- Without an API key, acceptance falls back to the public FOSS puppet-agent from `yum.puppet.com` (capped at 8.10.0).

## Beaker Setfiles

- Each acceptance target in `config/modules.json` references a `setfile` by name (filename stem).
- Corresponding YAML files live under `config/beaker/setfiles/` (e.g. `el9` → `config/beaker/setfiles/el9.yml`).
- The setfile defines the Docker image and platform for the Beaker SUT.
- At runtime, the runner builds a Docker image from the base setfile parameters (image, platform, docker_image_commands) plus Puppet Core install steps, then writes a clean setfile to `workspace/.beaker-setfiles/` that references the locally-built image tag.
- The rewritten setfile contains no secrets — only the image tag and platform metadata.
- When adding a new target OS, create the setfile first, then reference it in `modules.json`.

## Architecture Diagram Maintenance

`docs/architecture-flow.md` contains a Mermaid flow diagram and supporting reference tables that describe the end-to-end pipeline. Agents must update this file when making changes to any of the following areas:

| Area changed | What to update in `architecture-flow.md` |
|---|---|
| Runner pipeline stages (`lib/module_tester/runner.rb`) | Shared pipeline stage list; diagram node labels and order |
| Bootstrap logic or Gemfile patching (`lib/module_tester/bootstrap.rb`) | Gem swap branch in diagram; Bootstrap row in stage table; Gemfile conflict override in classification table |
| Classifier state logic or precedence (`lib/module_tester/classifier.rb`) | Classification precedence list; outcome state table |
| Downgrade override rules (`lib/module_tester/adapters.rb`) | Downgrade overrides table — add, remove, or update trigger conditions and reclassification outcome |
| Guardrails checks (`lib/module_tester/guardrails.rb`) | Guardrails row in stage table |
| Acceptance adapter or Docker isolation model (`lib/module_tester/adapters.rb`, `lib/module_tester/docker.rb`) | Two-Stage Docker Isolation Model section; Docker Container Modes table; S1/S2S/S2D node labels in diagram; FOSS fallback description |
| CI workflow (`github/workflows/compatibility-runner.yml`) | CI: Prepare section; diagram CI subgraph |
| Reporting outputs (`lib/module_tester/reporting.rb`) | Reporting section |

### Rules for diagram edits

- Use `<br/>` for line breaks inside Mermaid node labels — **not** `\n`.
- Do not remove `classDef` declarations or the `class`/`style` assignments at the bottom of the diagram block; they encode deliberate visual highlights for `modules.json` (datasource), gem swap (gemswap), and Docker isolation (isolation/TwoStage).
- If a new architectural concept warrants a highlight, add a new `classDef` and apply it consistently.
- Keep the diagram and the prose tables in sync — if the diagram changes, the corresponding prose section must also change.

## Editing Expectations for Agents

- Keep README user-focused and free from agent-operational instructions.
- Keep CONTRIBUTING focused on contributor process and schema rules.
- Put agent-specific process updates in this file.

## Adding New Incompatibilities

When a module is determined to be incompatible:

1. Add an entry to the table in [KNOWN_INCOMPATIBLE.md](KNOWN_INCOMPATIBLE.md) with module name, Puppet Core version tested, status, and detailed reason
2. Remove the module from `config/modules.json` so it is no longer included in test runs
3. Include migration path guidance if applicable
